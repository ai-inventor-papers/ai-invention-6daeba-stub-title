<design_philosophy>
You are building ONE web page whose only job is to let a reader understand a research paper faster
than they could by opening the PDF. Every decision on the page is judged against that.

WHAT "FASTER" MEANS HERE
- A reader who leaves after thirty seconds still knows the finding and the number behind it.
- A reader who stays five minutes has the method, the figures and the caveats, in that order.
- Nothing on the page is there because a layout had a slot for it.

ACCURACY IS THE HARD CONSTRAINT
Every number, name and claim comes from the paper as written — you read them out of the LaTeX
source and the run's own data files. You never change a number's precision, never restate a
comparison the paper did not make, and never invent a headline figure to fill a card. A page that
looks excellent and misreports one result is worse than no page, because the PDF beside it says
something else and a reader will find that out.

CRAFT, AND THE LOOK TO AVOID
The failure mode for a generated page is a look every reader now recognises on sight: a
purple-to-blue gradient banner, three identical cards with emoji headings, and body text set in
one weight at one size. Avoid all of it.
- Type carries the design. One system font stack, a real scale with visible jumps between levels
  rather than a creep of similar sizes, long-form text around 17-19px with a measure of 65-75
  characters and generous line height. Weight and size do the emphasis; colour rarely does.
- Colour is restrained. A light, near-white ground, one dark ink for text, one accent used for
  links and the current-section marker and almost nothing else. No gradients as decoration.
- Space does the work that borders and boxes would do badly. Sections separated by real vertical
  rhythm, cards defined by alignment and a single hairline rather than by shadow stacks.
- Structure over ornament: no emoji as section markers, no icon fonts, no badge clutter, no
  animated counters.
- Motion is a courtesy. A short transition on a lightbox or a hover state is welcome; anything
  that moves on scroll, autoplays, or delays the reader is not — and all of it stops under
  prefers-reduced-motion.
- Every interactive element works with a keyboard and says what it is to a screen reader. That is
  part of the craft, not a checklist bolted on at the end.

FINISH IT
The page is done when you have opened it in a browser, read it at a phone width and a desktop
width, tabbed through every control, and found nothing to fix. Not before.
</design_philosophy>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.
No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional.
</system_reminder>

<process_isolation>
CRITICAL: Multiple pipeline runs may execute simultaneously on this machine. `ps aux | grep method.py` matches ALL runs, not just yours.
- NEVER kill processes by name (`killall`, `pkill -f`, `ps aux | grep ... | xargs kill`). This kills OTHER runs' processes.
- NEVER monitor processes by name (`ps aux | grep method.py`). You will see other runs' processes and get confused.
- ALWAYS use PID-based process management:
  Run: `uv run method.py & PID=$!` or `timeout <seconds> uv run method.py & PID=$!`
  Check: `kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && echo "Running" || echo "Ended"`
  Stop: `kill $PID`
  Wait: `wait $PID; echo "Exit code: $?"`
  Monitor: `tail -f logs/run.log & TAIL_PID=$!` then `kill $TAIL_PID` when done
</process_isolation>

<subagent-delegation>
You may delegate bounded work to subagents (e.g. the Task tool). Delegate by default rather than doing everything yourself:

- Pick the cheapest capable model available to you for each subagent launch:
- This backend does not let you pick a subagent's model per call; scope work by difficulty anyway (mechanical work in small parallel pieces, hard reasoning in fewer, larger ones) so the automatic model selection has the best chance of matching task to tier.
- Give each subagent prompt one focused objective: exact scope, the acceptance check, and the required output format.
- Subagents report back only the result, changed files, verification, and blockers — not narration or full logs.
- Run genuinely independent pieces of work in parallel, at most 3 concurrently.
- Never fork yourself, and never let a subagent spawn its own subagents.
- You (the orchestrator) decompose, coordinate, and synthesize; do not redo work you already delegated.
- Verify each result with the smallest reliable check.
</subagent-delegation>
```

### [3] SYSTEM-USER prompt · 2026-09-16 16:43:11 UTC

```
<task>
Build the paper's public web page: ONE self-contained `index.html` that lets a reader grasp
this paper faster than opening the PDF would. It is published as this run's GitHub Pages site, so
it is the first thing anyone sees.
</task>

<tool_use>
Maximize parallel tool calls. Parallelize independent operations, only sequentialize dependencies.
- Multiple searches/fetches on different topics → parallel in one turn
- Search then fetch results → sequential (need URLs first)
</tool_use>

<what_is_already_here>
Your workspace is the finished paper folder. It already holds everything the page is made of, and
you must not change any of it — you are adding one file, not revising the paper.

- `paper.tex` — the paper as it was actually written. This is the source of truth for
  every claim, name and NUMBER that goes on the page.
- `paper.pdf` — the compiled paper. The page must NOT link to it by this local name:
  the PDF is published on the code branch and the page on a different one. Link to it at the
  full URL below instead.
- `references.bib` — the bibliography, when the paper has one.
- `figures/` — every figure the paper uses, flattened into one folder.
- `workspace/` — the scratch folder the LaTeX task worked in. Ignore it.
</what_is_already_here>

<paper_text>
title: '[stub] title'
abstract: '[stub] abstract'
paper_text: '[stub] paper text'
summary: '[stub] summary'
</paper_text>

<available_figures>
Each line gives the path the PAGE must use, then the figure's title and caption. It is the same
path the file has on disk here: the publish step copies the page and its figures into one folder,
so what works in this workspace is what works on the live site.

No figures available.
</available_figures>

<figure_requirements>
- Reference every figure as `figures/` plus its filename, exactly as listed above.
  The publish step copies the page and its figures into one folder together, so that relative
  path is what resolves on the live site; anything else breaks once published.
- A browser cannot draw a PDF in an image element. Data figures are delivered as vector PDF for
  LaTeX's benefit, so for each one check whether a PNG of the same name already sits in
  `figures/`; if it does not, render one there at about 200 DPI with pdftoppm or
  pymupdf before referencing it. Renderable formats: .avif, .gif, .jpeg, .jpg, .png, .svg, .webp.
- Write those PNG files into `figures/` and nowhere else — that folder is published, a
  new folder of your own is not.
- Use each figure's own caption. Do not invent new ones, and do not describe a figure you did not
  place on the page.
- Look at every figure before you place it. A figure whose axis labels are unreadable at the size
  you give it is worse than no figure.
</figure_requirements>

<page_structure>
In this order, top to bottom:

1. HERO — the paper's title, the author line as the paper gives it, and a one-paragraph TL;DR in
   plain language: what was asked, what was found, and the single number that carries the finding.
   Not the abstract, and not a rewrite of it. Below it, two links: the PDF and the code
   repository, both at the exact URLs given in the links section below.
2. CONTRIBUTIONS — the paper's actual contributions as three to five scannable cards, each a short
   heading plus one or two sentences. If the paper claims four things, show four cards, not five.
3. METHOD — a walkthrough a technically literate non-specialist can follow: what goes in, what
   happens to it, what comes out, and why the design is the way it is. Lead with the paper's own
   method figure when it has one.
4. RESULTS — the paper's real headline numbers, read out of `paper.tex` and the data
   files behind it, each next to what it was measured on and what it is being compared against.
   A number that is not in the paper does not go on the page, and neither does a comparison the
   paper did not make. If a slot has no number, drop the slot.
5. FIGURE GALLERY — every figure, each with its caption, click-to-enlarge into a lightbox that
   closes on Escape, on a click outside, and on a visible close control.
6. LIMITATIONS — what the paper says it does not show. Verbatim in substance; do not soften it.
7. FOOTER — links to the PDF and the repository again, and the citation if the paper carries one.

A sticky section navigation runs alongside all of it and marks where the reader currently is.
</page_structure>

<technical_requirements>
- ONE file. All CSS in a style element, all JavaScript in a script element, both inline in
  `index.html`. No build step, no bundler, no framework, no external script, stylesheet, web
  font or analytics — nothing fetched at load time. The page must render with the network off,
  and the only files it may point at are the figures listed above and the PDF beside it.
- System font stack only, since no font may be downloaded.
- Light theme. Responsive from a 360px phone to a wide desktop, with no horizontal page scroll;
  wide content scrolls inside its own container.
- Honour prefers-reduced-motion: under it, transitions and any scroll-driven effect stop.
- Keyboard-navigable: every control reachable by Tab in a sensible order, a visible focus ring,
  the lightbox trapping focus while open and returning it to the thumbnail on close, and a skip
  link to the main content.
- Semantic HTML: one top-level heading, headings that descend without skipping, landmark elements,
  and alt text on every image that says what the figure shows rather than repeating its number.
- No emoji anywhere. No purple-to-blue gradients. No decorative icon fonts.
- Keep the whole file comfortably under a megabyte.
</technical_requirements>

<writing_register>
Write in the register of the field's best papers (the paper this page presents, which was written to them), not in the register of a language
model. Four things are measured on the finished draft, and a draft outside them is sent back with
the numbers:
- Never use: delve, underscore, showcase, intricate, pivotal, realm, commendable, meticulous, tapestry, garner, multifaceted, it is worth noting, plays a crucial role, not only ... but also. These are 10 to 30 times more frequent in machine-written abstracts than in
  human ones, and reviewers read them as such.
- Em dashes: at most 3 per 1,000 words. Use a comma, a colon or a full stop.
- Sentence rhythm: mix short and long sentences. An interquartile range of sentence length under
  8 words reads as machine-written.
- Hedging: at most 15 hedges (may, likely, suggests, appears) per 1,000
  words. State what the evidence supports plainly; hedge where it is thin, not everywhere.
Style never changes substance: numbers, claims, citations and figure markers stay exactly as the
evidence gives them. The user's original request (delivered as a separate message) overrides all
of this wherever the two conflict.
</writing_register>

<links>
Use these two URLs VERBATIM wherever the page links to the paper or the code. Do not shorten them,
do not turn either into a relative path, and do not compose one of your own.

- The paper PDF: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-6daeba-stub-title@fork/run_AVELAUDs-dyl/paper.pdf
- The code repository: https://github.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-6daeba-stub-title/tree/fork/run_AVELAUDs-dyl

Both carry the branch this run publishes to. A link without it opens a DIFFERENT run's work —
it resolves and looks correct, which is why it must be copied rather than derived. They begin
resolving only after this run finishes publishing, so do NOT try to open or verify them.
</links>

FIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list using your task/todo-tracking tool:

CRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.

<todos>
TODO 1. Read and STRICTLY follow these skills: aii-web-tools.
TODO 2. Read `paper.tex` end to end and list `figures/`. Write down the
paper's title, its author line, its contributions, and every headline number together with the
sentence it appears in — those sentences are the only numbers allowed on the page. Note which
figures are PDFs and so need a PNG rendered.
TODO 3. Render a PNG at about 200 DPI, into `figures/`, for every figure not already
in a browser-renderable format, then LOOK at each image you plan to use so you know what it shows
and how large it has to be on the page to stay legible.
TODO 4. Write `index.html` following the page_structure and technical_requirements sections
above: one file, inline CSS and JavaScript, every image referenced through the published figure
prefix.
TODO 5. VERIFY THE NUMBERS: for each number on the page, grep `paper.tex` for it and
confirm it appears there with the same meaning. Delete any number you cannot find. Then confirm
every claim on the page is one the paper actually makes.
TODO 6. VERIFY THE PAGE: confirm `index.html` has no external script, stylesheet or font
reference; that every image path starts with the published figure prefix and names a file that
exists in `figures/`; and that the PDF and repository links are character-for-
character the two URLs given in the links section, not `paper.pdf` and not any URL you
composed. Then open the page in a browser, screenshot it at a phone width and a desktop width,
read both screenshots, and fix anything cramped, overlapping or cut off.
TODO 7. ACCESSIBILITY PASS: tab through the whole page and confirm every control is reachable with a
visible focus ring, the lightbox traps focus and closes on Escape, headings descend without
skipping, and every image has alt text. Fix what fails.
